# Neural-Nets-and-AI

This project consists of analysing the effects of changing various hyperparameters in MLP model
The results have been summarized in a report and tables of changes have been enumerated.
The second part of this project is analysing effects of changing padding and number of strides on 
CNN Algorithm and its impact on accuracy of test model .
The report is summarized in a PPT file and descriptive video has been uploaded on youtube with
